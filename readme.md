## Usage

## Usage

If you have docker & [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), clone this repo & run the following:
```shell
  # first, cd into the project directory, then run
  docker-compose up

  # this should respond with json, having an empty "data" array
  http://localhost:8080/tasks

  # this should respond with json, with meta.message : "task successfully enqueud"
  http://localhost:8080/ipfs/add?url=https://i.redd.it/5kwih5n5i58z.jpg

  # requesting this again should now show a taskÂ in the data array, including a "succeeded" timestamp:
  http://localhost:8080/tasks

  # congrats, you've put this url of a jpeg on ipfs: https://i.redd.it/5kwih5n5i58z.jpg
  # view it here:
  https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeDchVWNVxFcEvnbtBbio88UwrHSCqEAXpcj2gX3aufvv

  # connect to your ipfs server here:
  # click the "files" tab, and you'll see this hash: QmeDchVWNVxFcEvnbtBbio88UwrHSCqEAXpcj2gX3aufvv
  # this means you have a local ipfs node serving the image we just processed
  https://localhost:5001/webui
