This component of Data Together serves the JSON API. In isolation it doesn't do much, but when connected to the project as a whole it provides a variety of endpoints over https, which can be used to extract information from the Data Together database.

## Installation and Local Deployment

- install [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
  - if you are new to docker, you may want to test your install with the [default test case](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
- in the project directory, run ``docker-compose build && docker-compose up`
- the API should now be running at `http://localhost:3200/v0`, and the following endpoints should work:
  - http://localhost:3200/v0/urls for a list of URL's in the database
  - http://localhost:3200/v0/primers for a list of primers
  - see below for more information
  
  
### Generating Documentation

THe API documentation is OpenAPI/Swagger compliant and is generated by the `spectacle` node module. You will likely want to explore these docs, so you should generate them!

1. Install [spectacle](https://github.com/sourcey/spectacle) with `npm -g install specatacle-docs`
2. To dynamically generate API docs as you work, run `spectacle -d open_api.yaml` and edit `open_api.yaml` to see changes
3. Generate Static docs with `spectacle open_api.yaml`
4. Commit. Rinse. Repeat.

## Development

Right now modifying & updating code is a huge pain, but this is at least a start.
